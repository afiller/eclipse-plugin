		This chapter provides an introduction to software development with Vaadin,
		including installation of Vaadin, the Eclipse development environment, and any
		other necessary or useful utilities. We look into the design philosophy behind
		Vaadin, its history, and recent major changes.

		<p>
			The core piece of Vaadin is the Java library that is designed to make creation
			and maintenance of high quality web-based user interfaces easy. The key idea
			in the server-driven programming model of Vaadin is that it allows you to
			forget the web and lets you program user interfaces much like you would
			program any Java desktop application with conventional toolkits such as AWT,
			Swing, or SWT. But easier.
		</p>

		<p>
			While traditional web programming is a fun way to spend your time learning new
			web technologies, you probably want to be productive and concentrate on the
			application logic. With the server-driven programming model, Vaadin takes care
			of managing the user interface in the browser and <em class="firstterm">AJAX</em>
			communications between the browser and the server. With the Vaadin approach,
			you do not need to learn and debug browser technologies, such as HTML or
			JavaScript.

			<a href="intro.html#figure.intro.architecture" title="Figure&nbsp;1.1.&nbsp;General Architecture of Vaadin">Figure&nbsp;1.1, &ldquo;General Architecture of Vaadin&rdquo;</a> illustrates the basic architecture
			of web applications made with Vaadin. Vaadin consists of the
			<span class="emphasis"><em>server-side framework</em></span> and a <span class="emphasis"><em>client-side
			engine</em></span> that runs in the browser as a JavaScript program, rendering
			the user interface and delivering user interaction to the server. As the
			application runs as a persistent Java Servlet session in an application
			server, you can easily bind your application to data and logic tiers.
		</p>

		<p>
			Because HTML, JavaScript, and other browser technologies are essentially
			invisible to the application logic, you can think of
			the web browser as only a thin client platform. A thin
			client displays the user interface and communicates
			user events to the server at a low
			level. The control logic of the user interface runs on
			a Java-based web server, together with your business
			logic. By contrast, a normal client-server
			architecture with a dedicated client application would
			include a lot of application specific communications
			between the client and the server. Essentially
			removing the user interface tier from the application architecture makes our approach a
			very effective one.
		</p>

		<p>
            As the Client-Side Engine is executed as JavaScript in the browser, no browser
            plugins are needed for using applications made with Vaadin. This gives it a
            sharp edge over frameworks based on Flash, Java Applets, or other
            plugins. Vaadin relies on the support of GWT for a wide range of browsers, so
            that the developer doesn't need to worry about browser support.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Behind the server-driven development model, Vaadin makes the best use of AJAX
			(<em class="firstterm">Asynchronous JavaScript and XML</em>) techniques that make
			it possible to create Rich Internet Applications (RIA) that are as responsive
			and interactive as desktop applications. If you're a newcomer to AJAX, see
			<a href="architecture.technology.html#architecture.technology.ajax" title="3.2.1.&nbsp;AJAX">Section&nbsp;3.2.1, &ldquo;AJAX&rdquo;</a> to find out what it is and how
			AJAX applications differ from traditional web applications.
		</p>

		<p>
			Hidden well under the hood, Vaadin uses <em class="firstterm">GWT</em>, the
			<em class="firstterm">Google Web Toolkit</em>, for rendering the user interface in
			the browser. GWT programs are written in Java, but compiled into JavaScript,
			thus freeing the developer from learning JavaScript and other browser
			technologies. GWT is ideal for implementing advanced user interface components
			(or widgets in GWT terminology) and interaction logic in the browser, while
			Vaadin handles the actual application logic in the server. Vaadin is designed
			to be extensible, and you can indeed use any 3rd-party GWT components easily,
			in addition to the component repertoire offered in Vaadin. The use of GWT also
			means that all the code you need to write is pure Java.

		<p>
			The Vaadin library defines a clear separation between user interface
			presentation and logic and allows you to develop them separately. Our
			approach to this is <em class="firstterm">themes</em>, which dictate the visual
			appearance of applications. Themes control the appearance of the user
			interfaces using CSS and (optional) HTML page templates. As Vaadin
			provides excellent default themes, you do not usually need to make much
			customization, but you can if you need to. For more about themes, see
			<a href="themes.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Themes">Chapter&nbsp;7, <i xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Themes</i></a>.

			We hope that this is enough about the basic architecture and features of
			Vaadin for now. You can read more about it later in <a href="architecture.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Architecture">Chapter&nbsp;3, <i xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Architecture</i></a>, or jump straight to more practical things in <a href="application.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Writing a Web Application">Chapter&nbsp;4, <i xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Writing a Web Application</i></a>.
