		<p>
			When a user does something, such as clicks a button or selects an item, the
			application needs to know about it. Many Java-based user interface frameworks
			follow the <span class="emphasis"><em>Observer</em></span> design pattern to communicate user
			input to the application logic. So does Vaadin. The design pattern involves
			two kinds of elements: an object and a number of observers that listen for
			events regarding the object. When an event related to the object occurs, the
			observers receive a notification regarding the event. In most cases there is
			only one observer, defined in the application logic, but the pattern allows
			for multiple observers. As in the event-listener framework of Java SE, we call
			the observing objects <span class="emphasis"><em>listeners</em></span>.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the ancient times of C programming, <span class="emphasis"><em>callback functions</em></span>
			filled largely the same need as listeners do now. In object-oriented
			languages, we have only classes and methods, not functions, so the application
			has to give a class interface instead of a callback function pointer to the
			framework. However, Vaadin supports defining a method as a listener
			as well.
		</p>

		<p>
			Events can serve many kinds of purposes. In Vaadin, the
			usual purpose of events is handling user interaction in a user interface. Session
			management can require special events, such as time-out, in which
			case the event is actually the lack of user interaction. Time-out is a special
			case of timed or scheduled events, where an event occurs at a
			specific date and time or when a set time has passed. Database and
			other asynchronous communications can cause events too.
		</p>

		<p>
			To receive events of a particular type, an application must include a
			class that implements the corresponding listener interface. In small
			applications, the application class itself could implement the needed
			listener interfaces. Listeners are managed by the
			<code class="classname">AbstractComponent</code> class, the base class of all
			user interface components. This means that events regarding any
			component can listened to. The listeners are registered in the
			components with <code class="methodname">addListener()</code> method.
		</p>

		<p>
			Most components that have related events define their own
			event class and corresponding listener classes. For example, the
			<code class="classname">Button</code> has
			<code class="classname">Button.ClickEvent</code> events, which can be
			listened to through the <code class="classname">Button.ClickListener</code>
			interface. This allows an application to listen to many different
			kinds of events and to distinguish between them at class level. This
			is usually not enough, as applications usually have many components
			of the same class and need to distinguish between the particular
			components. We will look into that more closely later. The
			purpose of this sort of class level separation is to avoid having to
			make type conversions in the handlers.
		</p>

		<p>
			Notice that many listener interfaces inherit the
			<code class="classname">java.util.EventListener</code> superinterface, but it
			is not generally necessary to inherit it.

			where an application-specific class inherits the
			<code class="classname">Button.ClickListener</code> interface to be able to
			listen for button click events. The application must instantiate the
			listener class and register it with
			<code class="methodname">addListener()</code>. When an event occurs, an
			event object is instantiated, in this case a
			<code class="classname">ClickEvent</code>. The event object knows the related
			UI component, in this case the <code class="classname">Button</code>.
