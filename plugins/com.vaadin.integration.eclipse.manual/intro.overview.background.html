        <p>
            The library was not written overnight. After working with web user
            interfaces since the beginning of the Web, a group of developers got
            together in 2000 to form IT Mill. The team had a desire to develop a new
            programming paradigm that would support the creation of real user
            interfaces for real applications using a real programming language.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The library was originally called Millstone Library. The first version was
            used in a large production application that IT Mill designed and
            implemented for an international pharmaceutical company. IT Mill made the
            application already in the year 2001 and it is still in use. Since then,
            the company has produced dozens of large business applications with the
            library and it has proven its ability to solve hard problems easily.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The next generation of the library, IT Mill Toolkit Release 4, was
            released in 2006. It introduced an entirely new AJAX-based presentation
            engine. This allowed the development of AJAX applications without the need
            to worry about communications between the client and the server.
        </p>
        
        <div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="intro.overview.background.toolkit-5"></a>Release 5 Into the Open</h3></div></div></div>
            

            <p>
                IT Mill Toolkit 5, released at the end of 2007, took a significant
                step further into AJAX. The client-side rendering of the user interface
                was completely rewritten using GWT, the Google Web Toolkit. This allowed
                the use of Java for developing all aspects of the framework. It also
                allows easy integration of existing GWT components.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Release 5 was published under the Apache License 2, an unrestrictive
                open source license, to create faster expansion of the user base and make
                the formation of a development community possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                Stabilization of the release 5 took over a year of work from the
                development team. It introduced a number of changes in the API, the
                client-side customization layer, and the themes. Many significant changes
                were done during the beta phase, until the stable version 5.3.0 was
                released in March 2009.
            </p>

            <p>
                IT Mill Toolkit 5 introduced many significant improvements both in the API
                and in the functionality. Many of the user interface components in IT Mill
                Toolkit 4 and before were available as styles for a basic set of
                components. For example, the <code class="classname">Select</code> class allowed
                selection of items from a list. Normally, it would show as a dropdown
                list, but setting <code class="literal">setStyle("optiongroup")</code> would change
                it to a radio button group. In Release 5, we have obsoleted the
                <code class="methodname">setStyle()</code> method and provided distinct classes
                for such variations. For example, we now have
                <code class="classname">OptionGroup</code> that inherits the
                <code class="classname">AbstractSelect</code> component. In a similar fashion, the
                <code class="classname">Button</code> component had a
                <em class="parameter"><code>switchMode</code></em> attribute, set with
                <code class="methodname">setSwitchMode()</code>, that would turn the button into
                a check box. Release 5 introduces a separate
                <code class="classname">CheckBox</code> component. The
                <code class="methodname">setStyle()</code> method actually had a dual function,
                as it was also used to set the HTML element <em class="parameter"><code>class</code></em>
                attribute for the components to allow styling in CSS. This functionality
                has been changed to <code class="methodname">addStyle()</code> and
                <code class="methodname">removeStyle()</code> methods.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <code class="classname">OrderedLayout</code> was replaced (since the first
                stable version 5.3.0) with specific <code class="classname">VerticalLayout</code>
                and <code class="classname">HorizontalLayout</code> classes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Release 5 introduced <span class="emphasis"><em>expansion ratio</em></span> for applicable
                layout components. It allows you to designate one or more components as
                expanding and set their relative expansion ratios. The layout will then
                distribute the left-over space between the expanded components according
                to the ratios.  The release also introduces a number of new user interface
                components: <code class="classname">SplitPanel</code>,
                <code class="classname">Slider</code>, <code class="classname">Notification</code>,
                <code class="classname">LoginForm</code>, <code class="classname">MenuBar</code>,
                <code class="classname">UriFragmentUtility</code> and
                <code class="classname">RichTextEditor</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Client-Side Engine of IT Mill Toolkit was entirely
                rewritten with Google Web Toolkit. This did not, by itself, cause any
                changes in the API of IT Mill Toolkit, because GWT is a browser technology
                that is well hidden behind the API. The transition from JavaScript
                to GWT makes the development and integration of custom components and
                customization of existing components much easier than before. It does,
                however, require reimplementation of any existing custom client-side code
                with GWT. See <a href="architecture.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Architecture">Chapter&nbsp;3, <i xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Architecture</i></a> for more information on the
                impact of GWT on the architecture and <a href="gwt.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;9.&nbsp;Developing Custom Components">Chapter&nbsp;9, <i xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Developing Custom Components</i></a> for details
                regarding creation or integration of custom client-side components with
                GWT.
            </p>

            <p>
                The release introduced an entirely new, simplified architecture for
                themes. Themes control the appearance of web applications with CSS and can
                include images, HTML templates for custom layouts, and other related
                resources. The old themeing architecture in Release 4 required use of some
                JavaScript even in the simplest themes, and definition of a theme XML
                descriptor. In Release 5, you simply include the CSS file for the theme
                and any necessary graphics and HTML templates for custom layouts. For more
                details on the revised theme architecture, see <a href="themes.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Themes">Chapter&nbsp;7, <i xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Themes</i></a>. Old CSS files are not compatible with Release 5, as
                the HTML class style names of components have changed. As GWT implements
                many components with somewhat different HTML elements than what IT Mill
                Toolkit Release 4 used, styles may need to be updated also in that
                respect.

			<p>
				In the spring 2009, IT Mill Toolkit was renamed as
				<span class="emphasis"><em>Vaadin</em></span> to avoid common confusions with the name (IT
				Mill is a company not the product) and to clarify the separation between
				the company and the open source project. Vaadin means a female
				semi-domesticated mountain reindeer in Finnish.
			</p>

			<p>
				Vaadin 6 is still under development at the time of publication of this
				book, so the book does not yet include all the new features in Vaadin
				6. The most notable enhancements are the following external tools.
			</p>

			<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>Eclipse Plugin</li><li>WYSIWYG user interface editor under Eclipse</li></ul></div>

			<p>
				The Eclipse Plugin allows easy creation of Vaadin projects and custom
				client-side widgets. See <a href="getting-started.environment.html#getting-started.environment.eclipse-plugin" title="2.2.5.&nbsp;Vaadin Eclipse Plugin">Section&nbsp;2.2.5, &ldquo;Vaadin Eclipse Plugin&rdquo;</a> for details. The
				WYSIWYG editor will make prototyping easy and new users of Vaadin should
				find it especially useful or introducing oneself to Vaadin. Like Vaadin
				itself, the tools are open source.
			</p>

			<p>
				While the API in Vaadin 6 is essentially backward-compatible with IT Mill
				Toolkit 5.4, the package names and some name prefixes were changed to
				comply with the new product name:
			</p>

			<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>Package name <span class="package">com.itmill.toolkit</span> was renamed as <span class="package">com.vaadin</span>.</li><li>The static resource directory <code class="literal">ITMILL</code> was changed to <code class="literal">VAADIN</code>.</li><li>Client-side widget prefix was changed from "<code class="literal">I</code>" to "<code class="literal">V</code>". </li><li>CSS style name prefix was changed from "<code class="literal">i-</code>" to "<code class="literal">v-</code>". </li></ul></div>

			<p>
				Other enhancements in Vaadin 6 are listed in the Release Notes, which also
				gives detailed instructions for upgrading from IT Mill Toolkit 5.
