<h1>Specify archetype parameters</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Group Id</strong> identifies your organization and should be one of your organization's domain names in reverse. For example, if your organization owns example.com then you could use com.example as a group ID. It follows the same naming conventions as Java package names.</li>
<li><strong>Artifact Id</strong> is the name you want for your JAR file, minus the .jar extension. So, if you want your JAR file to be my-application.jar then you should use my-application as your artifact ID. Artifact ID should be lowercase with words separated by hyphens ("-").</li>
<li><strong>Version</strong> specifies the current version number of the code. Use the -SNAPSHOT suffix to indicate code that is still under development. For example, use version 1.0-SNAPSHOT to indicate you are currently developing version 1.0 but have not released it yet.</li>
<li><strong>Package</strong> is the main Java package name that you want to use for your code. It is generated automatically from the group ID and artifact ID, but you can change it to whatever legal package name you want.</li>
<li>Finally, there are additional properties available, depending on which archetype you've selected on the previous page. Please refer to the <strong>Description</strong> column for more information on each property.</li>
</ul>
